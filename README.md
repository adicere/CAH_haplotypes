# *CYP21A2* haplotypes database
Database of the most common haplotypes found in patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia 

## About the project

Accurate genetic diagnosis of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is complicated due to the presence of a highly homologous pseudogene (*CYP21A1P*), located in close proximity to disease associated gene (*CYP21A2*). In short-read sequencing reads originating from the functional gene and the pseudogene are often indistinguishable, and, as a result, reads may align ambiguously or be misassigned to the wrong locus. Existing tools for working with highly homologous regions are developed mainly for genotyping pharmacogenes and are not suitable for diagnosing patients with CAH, because at the moment *CYP21A2* has no unified catalog of haplotypes that modern bioinformatic tools could readily incorporate. This project is dedicated to creating a populational database of *CYP21A2* haplotypes, that can be implemented in CAH diagnostic.
